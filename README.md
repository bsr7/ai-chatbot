# ai-chatbot

This project is a simple demonstration of an AI chatbot application. It utilizes React for the frontend and Express.js for the backend to serve API requests to the OpenAI API, specifically using the text-davinci-003 model.

## functionality 

This chatbot allows users to interact with the GPT-3 model provided by OpenAI. Users can submit a question via a text input form. The question is then sent to the backend, which communicates with the OpenAI API to generate a response. This response is then sent back to the frontend, where it is displayed on the screen.
